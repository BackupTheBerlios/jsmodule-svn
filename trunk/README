Installing JSModule
-------------------

Since JSModule is meant to be used in a web server environment, you
must copy or link the file lib/JSModule.js to an appropriate
directory in your web server's document root.


Where to go from here?
----------------------

The documentation is probably a good place to start. Have a look
at doc/JSModule.html for instructions on using the library.

The project page at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/jsmodule/
has the source code repository, bug tracker, mailing lists, and
other information for the site.
